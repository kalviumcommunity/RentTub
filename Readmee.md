# RentEase – Property Rental Platform

## 📖 Project Overview
Finding a place to stay can often be stressful and time-consuming. I recently faced many challenges while looking for accommodation this semester, and I realized that these problems shouldn’t exist.  
To solve this, I am building **RentEase** – a platform where individuals can **rent properties** or **list their own properties for rent** with ease.  

The website will also feature an **AI-powered chatbot** to guide users in making better rental decisions.

## 🚀 Features
- **List a Property**: Users can add their property details and make them available for rent.  
- **Rent a Property**: Users can browse and rent properties listed on the site.  
- **AI Chatbot Support**: A smart assistant to help users with queries, comparisons, and decision-making.  

---

## 📅 Daily Plan
- **Day 1**: Gather all the resources required to build the website.  
- **Day 2**: Create a low-fidelity wireframe/design for the website.  
- **Day 3**: Create a high-fidelity prototype of the website.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Frontend**: React.js / Next.js (for UI)  
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express (for APIs)  
- **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL (for property listings & users)  
- **AI Chatbot**: OpenAI API / Dialogflow integration  
- **Design Tools**: Figma (for wireframes & prototypes)

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Add property filtering & search functionality.  
- Integrate secure payment options.  
- Add user authentication & profile management.  
- Mobile-friendly design for better accessibility.
